# Zomato-SQL-EDA-Project
This is a Exploratory Data Analysis project using PostgreSQL. In this I have conducted basic data anlysis on zomato dataset of Bangalore donwloaded from Kaggle - 
[Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/himanshupoddar/zomato-bangalore-restaurants). Firstly I did some basic data cleaning using Excel power query like deleting 
unnecessary columns , correcting datatypes, spliting columns etc...
Using SQL I performed SQL queries to filter , anlyazie and explore data using various factors like- The top dishes ordered, Top restaurants doing maximum business, Bottom rated restaurants, Location of top restaurants etc... You can view the and see my work
